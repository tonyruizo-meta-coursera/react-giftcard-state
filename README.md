## Task

You've revised the useState hook. You've also learned about working with primitive (string) data and complex data (state stored in objects).

In this code lab, you'll practice updating the state stored in an object, based on the user interacting with the app.

This code lab's app shows the Gift Card page of the Little Lemon Restaurant app, where a visitor initially has a Gift Card that they can use to have dinner for four.

The starter code shows the following information on the screen:

In other words, the text that shows on the screen is as follows:

- A title of "Gift Card Page",
- The name of the recipient, that in this case, says "Customer: Jennifer Smith",
- A descriptor of the state of the gift card, which is "Free dinner for 4 guests"
- Body text that states, "To use your coupon, click the button below"

The "Spend Gift Card" button is set up to execute a function when clicked. However, that event-handling function is empty.

That means that when serving the app with the starter code, if you click the "Spend Gift Card" button, there will be no change on the screen.

Your task is to complete the event-handling function for the "Spend Gift Card" button clicks, as detailed in the steps below.

When the code lab is successfully completed, after the "Spend Gift Card" button is clicked

In other words, the text that shows on the screen is as follows:

- The title of Gift Card Page
- The name of the recipient, that in this case, says "Customer: Jennifer Smith"
- A descriptor of the state of the gift card, which is "Your coupon has been used", and
- Body text that states, "Please visit our restaurant to renew your gift card"
